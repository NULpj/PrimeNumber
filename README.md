The PrimeChecker script checks if a given number is prime. It first handles edge cases, such as numbers less than 2, even numbers, and numbers ending in 5 (excluding 5 itself). It then checks divisibility from 3 up to half of the number, skipping even divisors. The script outputs whether the number is prime or not.
