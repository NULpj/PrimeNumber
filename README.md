A PrimeNumber is a number greater than 1 that is divisible only by 1 and itself. The script first handles edge cases, like numbers less than 2, even numbers, and numbers ending in 5 (except 5 itself). It then checks divisibility from 3 up to half of the number, skipping even divisors. If no divisors are found, the number is prime.
